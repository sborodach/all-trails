### AllTrails.com: Can we predict if a reviewer will leave a written comment with their star rating?

### The story
alltrails.com/us provides information and user reviews on hikes in the U.S. I frequent this site as a recreational hiker and in scrolling through comments I notced that 5-star reviewers often leave no comment with their review. Similarly, 4-star reviewers seemed to leave reviews at least as often as 5-star reviewers, and I wondered if it might be that 4-star reviewers leave comments more often than 5-star reviewers..., and I think the answer why is fairly intuitive.

### Gathering the data
I built a web-scraper using selenium to click through a trail's webpage to display all the reviews, pyMongo to store the HTML, and BeautifulSoup to parse the data, extracting reviewer information. Here are images of the scraper in action:

### Some basic EDA
After converting the mongo collections into pandas dataframe, I collected this data:



Distribution of Ratings |  Percentage Comments
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

There are two things to notice here. First, 1 and 2 star reviewers are scarce, as is often the case with reviewers on passion sites (in conrast to, say, retailâ€”think Amazon). More importantly for the question at hand: the 5-star comment percentage is lower than both 3 and 4 stars. From this we can already assume it is somewhat likely that comments are left less frequently by 5-star reviewers.

### Comparing 3, 4, and 5 stars
The null hypothesis for each test is nearly the same: comments are left at an equal rate between two of the three star groups, and the alternative hypothesis suggests there is some difference.

The results show that the p-value for 4/5 and 3/5 star comparisons are below the significance level, while the 3/4 is above. Thus, 5 star reviewers leave comments at a different rate than both 3 and 4 star reviewers, while there is insufficient evidence to show that 3 and 4 star reviewers leave comments at different rates.

**Further Study:**
After learning NLP I would like to create summaries based on comments left by reviewers in each of the 5 star raating categories. I am most curious to learn if 4-star reviewers often leave negative feedback or constructive criticsm in their reviews.
